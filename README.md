# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis Dashboard (2008–2017)

### 📊 Overview
This project is given by Labmentix Company which analyzes 10 seasons of IPL data (2008–2017) using **Tableau** to uncover insights about team strategies, player performance, and match-winning factors.

Two interactive dashboards were developed:
1. **IPL Analysis Dashboard** – Tournament-level insights: team dominance, toss decisions, Orange & Purple Caps, boundaries, and title winners.
2. **Key Player Insights Dashboard** – Player-level analytics: best fielders, finishers, powerplay specialists, and detailed batting/bowling stats.

### 🧠 Key Insights
- Teams batting first have a slight edge overall, but chasing success has increased in later seasons.

- Bowlers maintaining sub-8 economy across 100+ overs stand out as consistent match-winners.  
- Fielding excellence directly impacts team success in close matches.
